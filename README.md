# Authorization Form

A client just called you to say that they love their new website! There’s only one problem: 
- they don’t like how their contact page displays their personal information for all to see.

They’ve asked you to hide their website’s contact page behind a password form. In this project, I will accomplish this by using a React component to set up a **VERY** simple authorization layer. If the user has entered an authorized password, they will be presented with their contact information. Otherwise, they will see a login screen. P.s the password is `Swordfish` :)
